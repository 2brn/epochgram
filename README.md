## Timeline

<p><img src="images/timeline.png" alt="Timeline"></p>

The timeline is a scrollable, zoomable surface that collects records from all files in the vault, excluding folders ignored in Obsidian settings. It detects dates and date ranges in different formats and renders *one record per file per day*, in the following priority order:

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="images/pen.svg" width="16" height="16" alt=""> **Tracked changes** | Per-block edit history excluding YAML. Requires **⛭ Track changes** (Pro). |
| <img src="images/calendar.svg" width="16" height="16" alt=""> **Content dates** | Parsed content date (ranges), including <img src="images/recurring.svg" width="16" height="16" alt=""> **Recurring dates** (Pro). |
| -- Anchors -- | |
| **Filename dates** | Parsed filename date. |
| **Frontmatter dates** | YAML `date` property. |
| **Created dates** | File creation time. |

Each file has one anchor record that represents its canonical date. All other record types are optional. Drag and drop works only for anchor records, it updates the YAML `date` property, and the filename for daily notes.

> ```text
> -- FROM FILENAMES --
>
> `my_note.md` # ⚓︎ cdate
>
> `daily-01.01.2026.md` # ⚓︎ filename
>
> -- FROM CONTENT --
>
> ---
> date: 2026-02-02 # ⚓︎ YAML `date`
> ---
> 
> May 1, 2026 diary # 🗓 parsed content
> 
> Added new line... # ✐ tracked change
> ```

Each record appears as `note name ⸱ summary` (when **⛭ Show note name** is enabled). The summary is either the first _N_ words, markdown-aware (**⛭ Summary length** setting) or an AI summary (Pro). A custom summary can be set with YAML (`description: ...`) or from the context menu; manual summaries are never overwritten by AI, and clearing the field removes the override.

Timeline draws today as <img src="images/circle-today.svg" width="18" height="18" alt="">, weekdays as <img src="images/circle.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> and weekends as <img src="images/circle-filled.svg" width="18" height="18" alt="">. Entries are shown stacked or side by side when space allows, long entries are truncated with `…`. If space runs out, the day collapses to a few records and shows the rest as `(+n)`. When zoomed out, records collapse into placeholder bars <img src="images/rectangle-horizontal.svg" width="18" height="18" alt="">, with height based on record count.

> [!TIP]
> A top label shows the current date, and a vertical red line marks the distance from Today — at the default zoom, each day of redshift represents one month.

## Filters & Search

<p><img src="images/filters-search.png" alt="Filters and Search"></p>

There are collapsible filters under the <img src="images/settings.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> button.

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="images/scan-eye.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Drafts & reviewed. |
| <img src="images/pencil-ruler.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Drafts. |
| <img src="images/eye.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Drafts, reviewed, and hidden. |
| | |
| <img src="images/history.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Show tracked changes. |
| | |
| <img src="images/calendar.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Show content dates, ranges, and recurring. |
| <img src="images/square-code.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Show content dates including YAML. |
| | |
| <img src="images/paperclip.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Show non-text files. |
| | |
| <img src="images/hourglass.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> | Toggle Epochs view (Pro). |

A search bar at the bottom lets you search timeline records and shows the number of matches. Click it or run **⌘ Epochgram: Search timeline**. Search covers file names, content, AI summaries, Epochs, with support for fuzzy search.
  
| Search shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enter** | Open the matched file. |
| **Alt/Option+Enter** | Filter timeline records by the current query. |
| **!marked** | Show only marked records. |
| **"exact"** | Find exact string. |

## Actions

<p><img src="images/actions.png" alt="Actions"></p>

> [!TIP]
> Enable **⛭ Simple mode** for a minimal UI: red marks, hide/show review, toggle filters, and fewer controls.

Files in the vault are never modified unless you run an explicit file action. All attributes are stored in Epochgram data files, not in vault files.

Record context menu:

| Menu item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **<img src="images/square-pen.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Edit summary** | Edit the record summary. |
| **<img src="images/sparkles.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Summarize AI** | Summarize the record on-device with Chrome AI Bridge (Pro, desktop-only). |
| **<img src="images/tag.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Edit topic…** | Open the topics assignment popup; to remove topics, clear the input (Pro). |
| **<img src="images/pin.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Pin** | Pin the file at the *Today* position; or **⌘ Epochgram: Toggle pin for current file**. |
| **<img src="images/highlighter.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Mark** | Highlight similar records with a color; or **⌘ Epochgram: Toggle mark for current file**. |
| **<img src="images/pencil-ruler.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Draft**</br>**<img src="images/eye.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Review**</br>**<img src="images/eye-off.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Hide** | Change the file review state. |
| **<img src="images/pen-line.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Rename…** | Rename the file in the vault. |
| **<img src="images/folder-tree.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Move to…** | Move the file to another folder. |
| **<img src="images/trash2.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> Delete** | **Permanently delete the file**, or move it to trash, depending on Obsidian settings. |

> [!TIP]
> **⌘ Epochgram: Clear tracked changes for current file** → clear all file history at once.

## Review State

<p><img src="images/review.png" alt="Review"></p>

Epochgram is designed around the [C.O.D.E.](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) process (capture → organize → distill → express). New or indexed files appear as ***Draft***. After organizing the file and extracting the key points, the record can be marked as **Reviewed**. If the file changes later, the record returns to *Draft*, indicating it may need review again.

Not every record deserves space on the timeline. Some, such as minor tracked changes, can be marked **Hidden**. Hidden records either disappear from the timeline or are muted when the <img src="images/eye.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> filter is on.

> [!TIP]
> **⌘ Epochgram: Review all** → mark all records across the vault as reviewed.</br>
> **⌘ Epochgram: Toggle visibility for current file** → hide or show all records from the current file.

## Recurring (Pro)

<p><img src="images/recurring.png" alt="Recurring"></p>

You can create recurring records, which will appear on the timeline. To add one, set the `repeat` or `recur` property in YAML. Supported formats (see [RRULE](https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-5-3-recurrence-rule.html)):

```yaml
---
repeat: every day
repeat: every N days
repeat: every week on mon,tue
repeat: every N weeks on mon,tue
repeat: every month on D
repeat: every month on -D # D days from end of month; -1 = last day
repeat: every year on MM-DD
repeat: FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=5 # RRULE
---
```
 
## Similarity (Pro)

<p><img src="images/similarity.png" alt="Similarity"></p>

Similarity helps find related records. When you open a note, similar records on the timeline are highlighted using the current theme color. Epochgram includes multiple similarity settings that work across all platforms, including iOS and Android:

| Settings | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **⛭ Links** | Treat notes as related through inbound and outbound links. |
| **⛭ Tags** | Treat notes as related when they share tags. |
| **⛭ Title threshold** | Use Jaro–Winkler matching to group notes with similar names or paths. Higher values match more; `0` disables it. |
| **⛭ Semantic threshold** | Use an embedding [default model](https://huggingface.co/TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2) to find notes with similar meaning across the vault. Useful for notes that describe the same idea in different words. |
| **⛭ Topic threshold** | Use a zero-shot [default model](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-xsmall-zeroshot-v1.1-all-33) for similarity grouping. When you assign a topic to a note, Epochgram finds related records across the vault. Useful for broad themes like travel, projects, health, or photography, where notes may share meaning without direct links or tags. |

> [!TIP]
> Use **⛭** to open the model picker, or <img src="images/globe.svg" width="18" height="18" alt=""> to browse Hugging Face models.

Building semantic vectors and running topic classification can take a long time on slower machines. Long-running jobs show their progress in the status bar — hover over the progress item to see all jobs, or click it to cancel.

**Similarity** also groups related records automatically: when you mark one record, related records inherit the same color. These records behave as one group, so changing or removing the color updates the whole group, and inherited marks are recalculated automatically if the relation later disappears.

In addition to the standard red-to-violet palette, an extended palette is available in the submenu. This makes it easy to choose colors by activity. For example, I use <font color="#ADD8E6">glacier</font> for ski trip reports.

> [!TIP]
> **Alt/Option+Wheel/Up/Down** or **Two-Finger-Tap** → move through related records.</br>
> **⌘ Epochgram: Toggle mark for current file** → assign the next unique color from the palette.

## AI Bridge (Pro, desktop-only)

<p align="center"><img src="images/bridge.png" alt="AI Bridge screenshot"></p>

Epochgram Pro includes an **AI Bridge** that uses Google Chrome's on-device AI APIs for local summarization. When started, it runs a small local server on an available port at `http://127.0.0.1`. The bridge page can be opened from **⌘ Epochgram: Open AI bridge**, from the **⌀ AI** status bar button (red = disconnected), or automatically on startup if **⛭ Open Bridge AI on startup** is enabled. This page processes summary jobs in Chrome and returns the results to the plugin. All summarization data stays **only on your device** and is not sent to external services.

On first use, Chrome may need a user gesture to download the built-in Gemini Nano model, and the drive with your Chrome profile [should have](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/summarizer-api#hardware-requirements) at least **22 GB** of free space. The bridge page also serves as a control panel, showing connection and model status, queue progress, the current text preview, the latest result, and a chart with progress in gray and processing speed in blue. Keep it open while summaries are running. You can also adjust API settings and prompt/context texts. For larger notes, Epochgram can split input into chunks, summarize them separately, then merge the results.

You can use context placeholders. File summaries support `{{filePath}}` (full file path), `{{fileName}}` (file name), and `{{related}}` (summaries of related records). Epoch summaries support `{{bucket}}` (`day`, `2days`, `4days`, `week`, `2weeks`, `month`, `3months`, `6months`, `year`) and `{{related}}`.

> [!TIP]
> Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano currently officially supports English, Spanish, and Japanese for input and output text. You can still try forcing another output language in the prompt context; for example, I used this context for Ukrainian: `OUTPUT ONLY IN UKRAINIAN!`.

## AI Summaries & Epochs (Pro, desktop-only)

<p><img src="images/epochs.png" alt="Epochs"></p>

**⛭ Auto summarize** → when enabled, Epochgram automatically summarizes a record through the AI Bridge each time the file changes. Even when disabled, you can still run summarization for a specific record from its context menu.

**⛭ Generate Epochs** → when enabled, Epochgram creates a zoomable time map that groups many days into larger period summaries, helping you see the bigger picture and spot patterns without reading the timeline day by day. Epochs are generated hierarchically from day up to year, in essence, summaries of summaries. If highlighted records are present, Epochs are colored by the most common highlight color in that range. You can also edit or regenerate Epochs from the context menu.

> [!TIP]
> **⌘ Epochgram: Summarize all** → generate all missing AI summaries and Epochs.</br>
> **⌘ Epochgram: Export Epochs** → export as standalone HTML to your daily notes folder.

## Custom YAML

<p><img src="images/yaml.png" alt="Yaml"></p>

Epochgram supports the following custom YAML properties:

```yaml
---
date: 2026-01-01 # override the anchor date
description: my summary # override the summary
noindex: # exclude this file from all indexing
notracked: # don't track changes for this file
noparsed: # don't parse dates from this file's content
nosimilar: # don't match this file by similarity
similar: [links, tags, title, semantics, topics] # match similarity only by these relations
repeat: every day # create recurring records
recur: every day # repeat alias
---
```

## Settings & Data

<p><img src="images/settings.png" alt="Settings"></p>

Plugin data is mostly stored in the vault config directory, usually `.obsidian/`.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `epochgram-index.json` | Timeline/index data. |
| `epochgram-search.json` | Search cache. |
| `epochgram-summaries.json` | AI summaries and Epochs. |
| `epochgram-semantics.json` | Embeddings store. |
| `epochgram-topics.json` | Topic similarity store. |
| `plugins/epochgram/data.json` | Settings and view state. |

If Obsidian Sync is enabled, this data should synchronize between devices as long as **⛭ Sync → Vault configuration sync → Other file types** is turned on. License data is stored separately in `localStorage` and is not synced through the vault config.

> [!TIP]
> **Double-Click** a setting name/description → reset it to default.

Epochgram also provides **Rebuild** and **Reset** popups for rebuilding or clearing stored data:

- **⛭ Rebuild**
    - **⛭ All** → rebuild all data.
    - **⛭ Index** → rebuild the index; useful if something is broken or after an update.
    - **⛭ Search** → rebuild the [MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) cache.
    - **⛭ Semantics** → rebuild embedding vectors.
    - **⛭ Topics** → reclassify topics.
    - **⛭ AI summaries** → queue all files for AI summary generation.
